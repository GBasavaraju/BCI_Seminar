# BCI_Seminar : Predicting Mental Workload using EEG signals for drivers using ML and DL methods

Authors - Donald Pfaffmann, Ganavi Basavaraju, Nicolas Tabellion

This project is conducted on behalf of Master's Seminar at Saarland University - Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz GmbH.
Supervised by - Guillermo Reyes Fuentes and Maurice Rekrut. 
The Repository contain's notebooks of Data Evaluation and Classification Prediction, the code for entire Pipeline that includes interface and live prediction, and the report and the final presentation.

* Explored the potential of reducing car accidents through an innovative approach alerting drivers and transferring control to autonomous vehicles during cognitive distraction.
* Collected EEG data during non-distracted and distracted driving scenarios by setting up an experiment for users to drive and perform cognitive tasks on a Driving Simulator.
* Developed ML/DL Pipelines with several supervised learning algorithms and MLPs of which a neural network model achieved 73.4% accuracy on unseen data.
* Developed an interface for alarming drivers with visual and auditory cues and transferring control to an autonomous vehicle.
